Double Pendulum Simulation: An Exploration of Chaotic Behavior in Double Pendula
===
During my final year of high school, I designed my own independent study course in which I studied the classical mechanics of a double pendulum system. I created a double pendulum simulation with prior knowledge of differential equations and Newtonian mechanics. I studied the behaviors of various double pendulum systems by altering initial conditions and observing the consequent motion due to said perturbations. The general research objectives were I worked with my teacher Jeff Robinson and ultimately presented my work to the head of the science department at my high school, Adlai E. Stevenson High School.
